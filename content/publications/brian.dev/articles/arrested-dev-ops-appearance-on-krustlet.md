I had a great time on the Arrested DevOps podcast with Bridget Kromhout.  We chatted along with Taylor Thomas of the Deis team about [Krustlet](https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet).

You can [listen here](https://www.arresteddevops.com/krustlet/) or find it in all the usual podcast places, like Spotify and iTunes.
